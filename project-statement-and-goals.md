# Project Statement:
Through music streaming services, many of us have access to more music than we'll ever have time to explore on our own.  We build a system that can recommend new songs that will likely be compelling to a user.  A playlist that the user has already created will be used as ground truth for the users taste in music.

# Goals:
- Given a playlist as input, output a list of 10 tracks that will be welcomed additions to a users playlist.  Users want to discover new music and conveniently add music they already love to playlists.  Our system should be able to accomodate.

- Measure an R-Precision score that can give quantitative data indicating how our system compares to the state of the art and confirm that our model has successfully learned trends that generalize.

- Interpret our model to understand what features contribute to a harmonious playlist.
