# Motivation:
Discuss advances in RS systems, growing number of choices for users, and explosive growth in data availability that will make RS systems play an even much stronger role in the future.

# Background:
Spotify is a music streaming service which has over 40 million songs and 170 million users. Each of the songs can be combined into a playlist by editorial staff, Spotify users, algorithms; or a combination. Currently, the service has more than 2 Billion Playlists, a credit to Spotifyâ€™s work in making playlist continuation fun and addictive.
The company is striving to further improve its Recommendation System to predict songs which can be good candidates for playlists. In order to achieve this goal, the company created a challenge in which it released the Million Playlist Dataset (MPD), a Dataset containing 1,000,000 playlists created by users on Spotify. The aim of the participants in the challenge was to develop a system for the task of automatic playlist continuation. Details are below.
